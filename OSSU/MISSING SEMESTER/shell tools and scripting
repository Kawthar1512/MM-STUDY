Shell scripting

defining a variable in Shell

foo=bar
we can access the value by
echo  $foo

strings can be defined in two ways
single and double
single (') - literal string, it will not substitute variable values
double (") - delimited string, this will substitute values
Example
foo=bar
echo 'Hi there'
#this will print, Hi there

echo "Hi there $foo"
#this will print, Hi there bar

echo 'Hi there $foo'
# this will print Hi there $foo


mcd () {
    mkdir -p "$1"
    cd "$1"
}

$? - returns error code in the video
