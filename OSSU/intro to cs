---------------
when you encounter a problem, first question should be bo to mathematically solve the problem
Introduction to programming
-types of knowledge
1. Declarative knowledge (statement of fact)
2. Imperative knowledge a recipe, how-to do something
 my research...
 
So we'd say Programming is about writing recipes to generate facts... Basically, when i write a program, i'm creating a recipe that the computer will follow to process data or perform a function.

Algorithms are recipes/ recipes are algorithm e.g step by step on how to bake a cake

Computers are MACHINES that execute algorithms 
Question here.... I dont understand the calculation in the memory diagram
