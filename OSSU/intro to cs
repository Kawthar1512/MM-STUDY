---------------
when you encounter a problem, first question should be bo to mathematically solve the problem
Introduction to programming
-types of knowledge
1. Declarative knowledge (statement of fact)
2. Imperative knowledge a recipe, how-to do something
 my research...
 
So we'd say Programming is about writing recipes to generate facts... Basically, when i write a program, i'm creating a recipe that the computer will follow to process data or perform a function.

Algorithms are recipes/ recipes are algorithm e.g step by step on how to bake a cake

Computers are MACHINES that execute algorithms 
Question here.... I dont understand the calculation in the memory diagram

Basic primitives
1. Turing showed that you can compute anything with a very simple machine with only 6 primitives: left, right, print, scan, erase no op
2. real programming languages have 
 - more convenient set of primitives
 - ways to combine primitives to create new primitves
3. Anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming language

Aspects of languages
Semantics - the meaning associated with a syntatically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors
programn have only one meaning, there are no multiple meaning.. it follows the instruction and does what it needs to do.

ERRORS-
1. SYNTACTIC ERROR - 
2. STATIC SEMANTICC ERROR
3. NO LINGUISTIC ERROR
